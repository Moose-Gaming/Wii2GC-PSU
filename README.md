***A 3D model that converts you Wii power supply into a GameCube one***

In this repo you will find the .stl file required for 3D printing as well as the .FCStd for editing the model in FreeCAD (FreeCAD 0.20 and later).
The archive folder holds all my previous .stl files.

The [**Wiki**](https://github.com/MooseGmaing/Wii2GC-PSU/wiki) should guide you through succesfully modyfing your Wii PSU for GameCube compatibility.

This mod is reversable, as it does not damage the original PSU. It is also solder free - a drop in replacement
